<p>Your time is limited. By the time you finish this sentence, someone will visit and abandon your
website. Unless you give your visitors a reason to stick around, they're gone. High bounce rate is an
indicator of visitors' lack of interest.</p>
<br>

<h3>Here are some of the most common problems in website design:</h3>
    <ol>
    <strong><li>There's no clear path.</strong> You want to extend a warm welcome to your visitors. Give them an
    easy way in and through. Too much competition for attention is a turn off. When you
    provide too many options, the functional result is no options.</p></li> 
    <strong><li>Outdated design.</strong> Your site was state of the art in 2009. It's got a header, a couple of
    sidebars, and a big chunk of information running down the center. Guess what? It looks like
    it's nearly a decade old. Because it is. Time to refresh with current design thinking. The
    layout of a page has evolved over the past decade. These days the best sites break up content
    into smaller, digestible bits.</p></li>
    <strong><li> Overused stock images and icons.</strong>If visitors see the same image on multiple sites, it erodes
    trust. That picture of people sitting around the conference table? They sure get around to a
    lot of offices!</p></li>
    <strong><li> Too many textures and colors.</strong>You are trying to add interest, but you just add clutter. Limit
    colors and fonts. Maintain a thematic color scheme. For professional sites, try to limit the
    variety of fonts to three or fewer.</p></li>
    </ol>
